            <p>"Mate" is a popular drink in most South American countries and is originally from Argentina, Paraguay,
                and Uruguay. It is made using leaves and
                small branches of the yerba mate plant, which are steeped in hot water to make mate or cold water to
                make tereré.</p>
            <p>
                Drinking mate has numerous health benefits, both for the body and the mind. The Guarani population has
                long recognized the medicinal properties and have been
                growing and drinking mate for hundreds of years. This drink is rich in antioxidants, which are related
                to reducing the risk of many diseases, it has a large number of
                vitamins, including vitamins A, C and E, and minerals such as iron, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium.

            <h2>How to prepare your first mate</h2>
            <section class="setp1_par">
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>When you’re pouring the dried leaves from
                the packet into the mate (the vessel) you need just the right amount; you don’t want the mate to
                overflow, but you
                don’t want it empty either. Using your eye as a guide (forget about using a measure), fill the recipient
                three quarters full,
                then cover it with your free hand, tip it upside down, give it a shake, and blow off the dust that
                sticks to your hand (remember this part otherwise you’ll stain the first thing you touch.)</p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <section class="step_2_par">
                <p>Now tilt the mate so that the yerba rests on one side, and slowly pour a little water into the space
                    created. We restate that, in order to avoid burning the yerba and reducing its flavour, the water
                    shouldn’t be boiling! Let it rest for a moment before moving on.</p>
                <p>Now it's time to put the bombilla! The bombilla is a metal straw used to drink the infusion and it
                    should be placed into the moist area of the yerba where you poured the water. One practical tip:
                    cover the mouthpiece with
                    your thumb as you plunge it in; that way you’ll avoid failing the exam by blocking the bombilla with
                    pieces of yerba.</p>

            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <section class="step_3_par">
                <p>Now we’re ready to start serving. Pour a little of hot water (The ideal range is between 70º and
                    80ºC, not boilling) each time and always in the same part of the mate where the bombilla is placed
                    to make it last as long as possible.</p>
                <p>And now, it's time to drink it!</p>
