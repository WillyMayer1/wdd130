                Mate is an infusion that is prepared with the leaves of Ilex paraguariensis, a tree that is exclusive to
                the subtropical regions of South America. It has been consumed for many centuries and has established
                itself throughout history as the favorite drink of millions of people in Argentina (the world's leading
                producer and exporter), as well as in Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil. <br><br>
                History recognizes the Guarani of the Paran√° jungle as the pioneers of mate and the creators of their
                particular form of consumption. They used yerba for nutritional and therapeutic purposes, but also as a
                symbolic and spiritual element. The word "mate" comes from the Guarani "Caa-mate", where "Caa" means
                plant or herb, and "mate" refers to the gourd they used to drink it. <br><br>
                With the arrival of the Spaniards, the consumption of mate spread throughout the territory of the
                colony. In this period, the Jesuit missionaries were the pioneers in cultivating and extending the
                consumption of mate. Later, the "gauchos" (a kind of Argentine cowboy) settled throughout Argentina and
                adopted yerba mate as part of their identity. They sat around the fire and, next to their barbecue, they
                heated water and passed the mate from hand to hand. During the independence of Argentina in the 19th
                century, the tradition of drinking mate became entrenched in the country's national culture.

            <h1 class="mate_nut_title">Why you should drink mate?</h1>
            <p class="mate_nut_par">
                One of the main reasons people love yerba mate is its stimulating and energizing effect, the same reason
                people like to drink coffee or tea in the morning (although yerba mate has undeniable advantages over
                these beverages). The caffeine contained in yerba mate stimulates the nervous system and increases
                concentration and energy levels; ideal to undertake any activity in your daily routine. <br><br>
                However, the caffeine in yerba mate is gentler than, for example, energy drinks. These commercial drinks
                are sometimes so high in caffeine and sugar that they cause insomnia, nervousness, rapid heart rate, and
                nausea. <br><br>
                Beyond that, yerba mate is considered one of the best and healthiest drinks in the world. Its
                antioxidant power protects cells and improves all body functions. It contains almost all the
                micronutrients that the human body needs like vitamins, essential minerals, and others.
                Yerba mate is also known for its medicinal properties, for improving the immune system, and for
                preventing diseases such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, Parkinson's, colon cancer, Alzheimer's, and
                cardiovascular problems. Yerba mate also acts to protect the bones and reduce bad cholesterol.
                Digestion can also be greatly improved by drinking yerba mate. This natural tea stimulates bowel
                movement and can relieve constipation by helping the body in its natural process of eliminating waste
                and toxins. And as if that were not enough, mate improves cognitive functions, is an effective
                neuro-protector, and has detoxifying, diuretic, and anti-inflammatory effects.
