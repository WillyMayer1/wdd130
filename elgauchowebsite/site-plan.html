        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
        <p>The primary purpose of my website is to announce to visitors, or viewers, some of the Argentinian cultures,
            especially about the “mate”, which is a traditional drink in this part of the continent. With this website,
            everyone who wants to visit Argentina in the future will have an idea about what to expect if they want to
            visit
            it one day, or if they want to know some of the things that Argentinian people do. </p>
        <h4><strong>How to prepare mate</strong></h4>
        <p>One of the activities that I want that viewers do on my website is to make a specific tour, showing first
            some
            pictures of the typical vessel (called “mate”) sometimes made with wood, clay, or any other material that
            could
            resist hot drinks. And then, we will show the special ingredient called “yerba mate” (or “yerba” to
            shortcut) which
            is a specific cut and prepared herb. After showing the mate and yerba mate, the website shows how to prepare
            the mate
            , starting by filling the mate with the yerba, next, we will introduce and specific straw called “bombilla”,
            which is
            only to drink mate, the instructions will say that we need to put the straw into the mate, and then, we can
            fulfill
            the mate with hot water. This is the main way to prepare mate, if the customer prefers, he or she can add
            sugar,
            spices, and fruit peel to change the flavor.</p>

        <h3>About Mate</h3>
        <h4><strong>Answering questions</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Some of the questions that viewers could make are, principal, “what is mate? How could I drink this? Is this
            healthy?”
            Other questions that viewers could make is “What is the history of this kind of drink? Is this a culture,
            and, there
            is a way about how to drink it?” Our website will be prepared to answer these questions and more.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Some history & information</strong></h4>
        <p>And now, how our visitors or viewers know how to prepare mate, we will show some of the history (just
            principal) about this drink.
            We will show why is so important for Argentinian people to drink this with family instead alone. And, if the
            visitor wants, why he
            or she could consider adopting this tradition. Also, it will contain a section where it will explain in
            detail all the nutritional
            functions it contains so that anyone (especially people with knowledge in nutrition) can know what
            properties it contains.</p>

        <h3>Contact Me</h3>
        <h4><strong>A little about me and contact me</strong></h4>
        <p>
            And, at last, a section that everyone can contact me through my social media and email to do specific
            questions or if he or she wants
            more information about it. I will explain a little about my history knowing this culture, learned by the
            country people of this part
            of Argentina. Because I (and possible everyone who did not visit Argentina before) did not learn some of
            these basics before, and, when
            I participated in a meeting with Argentinian friends, I drank it in a way that some of the guests showed a
            little impressed because the
            way that I was drinking mate it is not the right way, and then show me how to drink it correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe you will think “why is this website important?”. One of the things that will distinguish our website
            from others is that we will
            prepare a complete, but simple, tour about the mate. We will show not only how to prepare it, but how this
            culture started and how this
            changed throughout the years, our webpage will answer some of the typical questions in a simple way that
            everyone can understand and share
            this info with others. This drink is very common in some countries in South America (for example Chile,
            Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina)
            with this website, you can use this information if you consider visiting some of the countries before too.
